# Classic-To-do-App
A simple to do app that lets you add tasks you want to do in the future and show you the list of the task you want to accomplish. It is connected to a database so you can retrieve your data even if you restarted the app. I have used Java's library Swing to develop the desktop application and MySQL for the database to keep track of your tasks.
